Infrastructure management tools, specifically Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ones, have trained us to think we can only manipulate a cloud account by applying a static infrastructure declaration, or blueprint, which makes it challenging to manage existing cloud infrastructure and reconcile future changes done outside of the IaC tool of choice. [IaSQL](https://iasql.com), like IaC tools, allows creating, updating or deleting infrastructure in the cloud. However, it also makes it possible to import all existing cloud resources. IaSQL also allows importing recent changes done outside IaSQL with the `iasql_sync()` [function](https://docs.iasql.com/functions) after the initial 2-way binding is setup. IaC provides a blueprint of your infrastructure, while IaSQL provides the actual representation of your infrastructure.

### Understand how each infrastructure component plays into the big picture

The infrastructure of a production system can get complex quickly. Infrastructure components can be used by different resources. A change to a cloud resource can have undesired side effects, or outages, in the application layer when the relationships across infrastructure components is not clear enough. Infrastructure changes are less prone to errors when the complete representation of all the relevant resources is in a relational database. Furthermore, debugging for outliers or misconfiguration can be easily done with SQL. Sometimes the issue under the surface is not misconfiguration, but just configuration drift which can happen when a cloud resource has not been updated in a long time or since its creation.

### Freedom to use any cloud tool

Application engineers often need to move quickly and create new infrastructure through a cloud UI that could also depend on infrastructure previously created through an IaC tool. However, subsequent changes to the IaC declaration can affect the infrastructure created via the cloud UI. We created the IaSQL `sync` command to let teams create resources outside of IaSQL while still managing said resources. This flexibility makes it possible to have multiple cloud management tools across different teams without getting locked into a single tool. When using IaSQL's `sync`, there is no need to constantly recreate changes or deal with static state files to stay up to date with infrastructure changes.

### Backups and disaster recovery

Every production system should to have contingency plans in case issues arise. Cloud outages and human errors can delete or corrupt infrastructure. IaSQL provides a recovery system plan based on up-to-date database backups. It is trivial to apply a snapshot after an outage and re-deploy the entire production infrastructure in a simple step.

In IaSQL, cloud infrastructure is data through a 2-way binding between a cloud account and a PostgreSQL database. Cloud infrastructure declarations are great in theory, but they don't describe what is *actually* in the cloud account. Furthermore, SQL can natively and ergonomically encode relations in a way that most configuration-based syntaxes simply cannot. The ability to represent cloud infrastructure in a PostgreSQL database through a 2-way connection allows making CRUD changes while also tracking changes done elsewhere. SQL is also the lingua franca of data which means that many developers are already familiar with it. All of this opens the door to new opportunities in terms of team collaboration, vendor locking, cost optimization, and disaster recovery strategies.
